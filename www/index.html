            <h3>Generations of Migrants</h3>
            <p>According to the Migration Policy Institute (MPI) when adding together immigrants and their U.S.-born children (the first and second generation), the total comes to about 90.8 million people, or 27% of the civilian noninstitutionalized U.S. population in 2023. A classic Gallup survey finds the immigrant imprint goes even deeper: only 56% of Americans said they, their parents, and their grandparents were all born in the U.S., while 44% reported that either they themselves, a parent, or at least one grandparent had immigrated. </p>
            <p>Historically, the largest inflows feeding these diasporas were overwhelmingly European – especially German, Irish and Italian – whereas today the single most prominent origin is Mexican, which makes a sharp contrast with how heavily recent enforcement and deportation policies have targeted Latin American migrants.</p>

            <p class="sankey-description">This diagram shows the flow of individuals through ICE's enforcement pipeline from 2023-2025. An <strong>arrest</strong> occurs when ICE apprehends someone. After arrest, individuals may be transferred to ICE <strong>detention</strong> facilities or released (shown as "No Detention"). Some individuals appear in detention without a corresponding ICE arrest in our data—these may represent transfers from Customs and Border Protection or other agencies (shown as "No ICE Arrest"). From detention, individuals either proceed to <strong>removal</strong> (deportation from the United States) or are released. This visualization tracks unique individuals through each stage of the enforcement process.</p>

            <p class="detention-description">
                Before being removed from the United States, detained individuals are often transferred between 
                multiple detention facilities across the country. Some people experience dozens of transfers, 
                spending months or years moving through the detention system. This visualization reveals the
